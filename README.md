# Node.js, Sequelize & MySQL Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of practice scripts designed to build and demonstrate backend development skills using **Node.js**, **Sequelize ORM**, and **MySQL**. Each script explores different aspects of relational database management and ORM usage, including various types of model relationships and data operations.

## Purpose

- To practice and reinforce concepts of relational databases and ORM in a Node.js environment.
- To experiment with Sequelize features such as model definition, associations, data validation, and bulk operations.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Sequelize ORM
- MySQL

## Key Features

- Implementation of one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
- Model definitions with data validation
- Bulk data insertion and advanced queries
- Example scripts for different association types

## Project Structure

```
hello-world/
  aggregation.js
  book.model.js
  manytomany.js
  manyTomanyPractice.js
  onetomany.js
  oneToOne.js
  package.json
  server.js
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd hello-world
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up MySQL:**
   - Ensure you have a MySQL server running.
   - Update the database credentials in each script if needed.
4. **Run a script:**
   ```bash
   node oneToOne.js
   # or any other script, e.g.
   node onetomany.js
   ```

## Notes

- Each script is independent and demonstrates a specific concept or relationship.
- The database connection details (database name, user, password) are hardcoded for demonstration purposesâ€”update them as needed for your environment.
